Technology: HTML, CSS
Purpose: Display a level of understanding of HTML, CSS

I am on a full stack development course run by the Code Institute.  First part of the course covers HTML, CSS.  This is the first assignment of three demonstrating my understanding of the material presented as this part of the course.
The assignment is based on a city in the UK, Preston, and the attractions that can be found in and around the city that might be of interest to locals and outsiders alike.
At the top of the page a menu bar is presented.  As a limited number of attractions have been displayed on the page, the menu bar has been organised as links to the named attrations.
Under the menu bar, two pictures of the main parks in the centre of the city is displayed side-by-side.  A zooming-in effect is deployed on page's first load and subsequent refreshes.
Below the above images, each attraction is presented by name, a thumbnail, and a brief description.  The name of each attration act as a link to the web page providing more information on what is on offer. Certain effects have been incorporated as the mouse hovers over the name, description, and thumbnail of each attraction presented.
Steps were taken to make the page responsive too.
