# Technologies/Features used

HTML,
CSS,
Flexbox,
Mediaquery,
Fontawsome

# Installation

Clone the project, ensuring the folder structure is replicated.  Once one page is loaded, in the browser, the rest will become accessible via the menu bar.

# Test

Each page was loaded in a browser and the provided links, as well as the pseudo features, were tested to ensure functionality. 
Pages and CSS were, also, validated using W3C validator.
Zooming feature applied to images on the home and gallery pages is in effect on the first load of the page, as well as subsequent refreshes.

# Original Idea

I am on a full stack development course run by the Code Institute.  First part of the course covers HTML, CSS.  This is the first assignment of three demonstrating my understanding of the material presented as this part of the course.  Since I have recently moved to Preston, I took advantage of the opportunity to marry the two ideas: complete the assignment, and get to know the new city I live in.
The assignment contains three web pages, Home, Gallery, Contact.  A menu bar acts as the link to each page. The footer bar, on all pages, provides a link to the most popular social media sites.
The code structure allows for responsiveness.
Below is a brief description of each page.

## Home Page

This page contains a brief history of the city and some important dates/events occuring in/around it.
At the top of the page is the image of Cromwell's brilliant victory over the Duke of Hamilton, which is of great national importance. 

## Gallery Page

This page contains some of the attractions that can be found in and around the city that might be of interest to locals, and outsiders alike.
At the top of the page is an image of the Ribble river running through the city and acting as the city's artery through the history; facilitating commerce, transportation, and social interaction with neighbouring towns/cities.
Each attraction is presented by name, an image, and a brief description.  The name of each attration act as a link to a web page providing more information on what is on offer. 
Certain effects have been incorporated as the mouse hovers over the name, description, and image of each attraction.

## Contact Page

This page has been provided to gather feedback from visitors to attractions to be used for future improvements.
The background image is from the Corn Exchange building and the martyrs memorial, in front of it, dating back to 1842.  On that year during the workers' strike, against wage cuts, four people were shot and killed.
Certain effects have been incorporated as the mouse hovers over each input box, textarea, and submit/reset buttons.

## Fututre Enhancements

The original idea could be further developed based on visitor groups; e.g. some attractions might be more appealing to families, others to couples, etc.  The feedback page could be used to gather information in tailoring attractions to specific groups.
