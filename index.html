            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">
                Preston began as a village. It was called Priest&apos;s tun, which means a priest&apos;s farm or estate. 
                In the 12th century, it grew into a town, partly because of its position by being on a river, making it cheaper to transport goods by water. Preston was also the first place inland where the river could 
                be bridged so a great deal of traffic passed through the area.
                In 1179 it was given a charter. (A charter was a document giving the townspeople certain rights).
                Preston was too small to have stone walls but it did have stone gates, where tolls could be charged on goods entering the town. By the 12th century, it had a weekly market. 
                From the 13th century, it also had a fair. In the Middle, Ages fairs were like markets but they were held only once a year for several days.
                In the Middle Ages, there was a leper hospital just outside Preston. It was dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. About 1260 the Franciscan friars arrived in the town.
                Preston, for most of its history, was a small town but relative to other market centres in the county it was always of significant economic importance, 
                being considered the richest borough in the 14th Century.
                In 1539 Henry VIII closed the friary but most of the people of Preston remained staunch Catholics.
                Tudor Preston was a flourishing town, with the main industry being textiles. Both linen and wool were made in here.
                Like all towns at that time, Preston suffered from outbreaks of plague. A particularly severe outbreak occurred in 1631. But each time it struck the population soon recovered.

            <h3>War</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">
                In 1642 came the civil war between the king and parliament. The people of Preston steadfastly supported the king. 
                But in February 1643 parliamentary troops attacked Preston and quickly captured it. The mayor was killed. 
                However, the royalists recaptured it in March 1643. They did not hold it for long. In April 1643 the royalists 
                were forced to withdraw from Preston and the surrounding area. The civil war ended in 1646 and the King was captured.
                In 1688 James II was deposed as king of England and Scotland but in 1715 a Scottish army attempted to put his son, James III back on the throne. The 
                Scottish army marched into Preston, realizing their position was hopeless the Scots surrendered. The Scots returned in 1745 and they 
                marched as far as Derby but they then turned back and no battle took place in Preston.
                Preston was the stage for battles of national importance - in 1648 Cromwell's brilliant victory over the Duke of Hamilton and in 
                1715, the defeat of the Jacobites. 
                Preston escaped serious bomb damage during the Second World War and nobody was killed. However, in 1944 61 people were killed when a plane crashed in 
                Freckleton.

            <h3>Trade And Industry</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">
                In the 18th century, Preston continued to trade with Europe. Hemp, timber, and iron were imported from the Baltic region. Preston also traded with the 
                West Indies. Some ships from Preston took part in the slave trade. 
                For centuries wool and linen were woven in Preston. However, by the late 18th century they had given way to cotton. The first cotton mill in Preston opened 
                in 1771. Some cotton was made in mills but there were also handloom weavers, who made cotton cloth in their own homes.
                The first cotton mill in Preston opened in 1771. Some cotton was made in mills but there were also handloom weavers, who made cotton cloth in their own 
                homes. By 1835 there were 40 cotton mills. 
                By the time of the first census in 1801, Preston had a population of 11,887. By the standards of the time, it was a large town. Moreover, Preston grew rapidly 
                during the 19th century. By 1851 Preston had a population of 69,361. This was despite epidemics of cholera in 1832 and 1848.
                There was industrial unrest in the early 19th century with demonstrations in 1808 and 1818 and a strike in 1836. In 
                1853-54 the employers locked out the employees.
                Albert Edward Dock was built in 1892. As well as exports and imports to other countries there was considerable coastal trade in the 19th century. 
                The Leyland Steam Wagon Company was formed in 1896. In 1904 they began making petrol-driven vehicles. The name of the company was changed to Leyland Motors 
                in 1907. After 1918 the cotton industry, which had dominated the town for so long, collapsed. There was very high unemployment.
                In 1918 aircraft manufacture began in Preston. Courtaulds rayon factory opened in 1939. 
                In the late 1970s as firms such as British Leyland began making people redundant. Furthermore, the Courtaulds factory closed in 1979 with 
                the loss of nearly 3,000 jobs. It was a severe blow to the local economy. Mass unemployment returned. The only bright spot in the gloom was the expansion 
                of service industries like tourism.

            <br>
            <p class="para-text">
                In 19th century, Preston was dirty and unsanitary. The situation improved a little in the late 19th century with the building of sewers 
                but even in the early 20th century many of the townspeople used earth closets (basically a bucket that was emptied at night into a cart by the &apos;night soil 
                men&apos;).
                During the 19th century, there were some improvements in the amenities.
                In 1809 a dispensary where the poor could obtain free medicines opened.

                From 1699 the streets of Preston were lit by oil lamps. 
                From 1800 Preston had night watchmen that patrolled the streets at night. The first modern police force in the town was formed in 1836. The Royal Infirmary opened in 1870. 
                The first museum in  Preston opened in 1841. Then in 1855, a cemetery was opened. Also in 1855 St Johns Church was built. A new Town Hall was built in 
                Preston in 1867. Also in 1867, a cattle market was built in the town.
                Miller Park was laid out in 1864. Moor Park opened in 1867. From 1879 horse-drawn trams ran in Preston. Also in 1879, a free library opened in the town 
                hall. The first telephone exchange in Preston opened in 1881. In 1893 the Harris Museum and Art Gallery opened. A training school for deaf and dumb 
                children opened in 1894 and Victoria Jubilee Technical School opened in 1897.
                The 20th Century was a period of economic and social diversification as Preston responded to regional, national and global changes.

                A Cenotaph was built in Preston in 1926.
                In the 1950s immigrants from India, Pakistan, and the West Indies came to Preston.
                In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a great deal of slum clearance in  Preston and many new council houses were built. The Larches estate was built at Ashton.
                Other estates were built at Middleforth Green, Brookfield, and Penwortham. From the mid-1970s, the council’s policy changed from tearing down old houses to 
                giving grants to the inhabitants to improve them.
                The Preston Bypass was built in 1958. The St Georges Shopping Centre was built in 1964. 
                As old factories and terraces were demolished, new modernist buildings such as Preston bus station (1969) and the Guild Hall (1972), were constructed. 
                Manufacturing declined in importance and its place was taken by service industries. Today the University of Central Lancashire, which can trace its history back to a Sunday school founded in the 1830s, is an expanding influence on the fabric of modern Preston.
                The Fishergate Centre opened in 1986.
                The ring road was built in the early 1970s. A bus station and a Guildhall were also built in Preston then. In 1999 Preston Guildhall was refurbished using 
                a National Lottery grant.
                In 2002, Preston was made a city.

                scientists. He was also a poet and a mountaineer, he completed the first solo ascent of the second-highest peak in the Alps carrying only a ham sandwich 
                and a small bottle of tea. Early stimulus for his scientific studies was provided by his attendance at lectures at the Institution for the Diffusion of 
                Knowledge in Cannon Street, Preston, while he was living in the town.

                The lamb on the city shield is a biblical image of Jesus Christ, and the same image that represented 7th-century bishop St Wilfrid, the city's patron saint 
                who is historically linked to the city's establishment. The "PP" on the city shield stands for "Princeps Pacis" (Prince of Peace), another title for Christ 
                invoking Him as protector of the city, though it is also often taken to stand for the city's nickname "Proud Preston". In fact, there were originally three 
                letters "P" on the coat of arms, with one being lost over time.
